<h3>This only works in the Forest map, read below for a explination.</h3>

Gorilla Texture Loader is a plugin for the VR game Gorilla Tag, by <a href="https://www.gorillatagvr.com/">Another Axiom</a>. This plugin allows the user to override the default textures in the forest map. Due to the amount of materials for the canyon map, I have decided to only add support for the forest map. In the future I may expand oppen this but I am lazy.
